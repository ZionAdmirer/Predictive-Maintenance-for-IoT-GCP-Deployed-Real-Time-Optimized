Predictive Maintenance for IoT

Welcome to my personal project on Predictive Maintenance for IoT! This self-driven initiative uses machine learning (ML) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to predict equipment failures for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as industrial sensors. It’s a scalable, cloud-based system designed to help businesses prevent costly downtime with fast, accurate predictions. Built from scratch with TensorFlow and GCP, it showcases my passion for AI and cloud technologies.

🌟 Why This Project?

As a third-year computer science student, I’m passionate about using AI to solve real-world problems. I built this project to explore how ML and cloud systems can keep industrial equipment running smoothly. It demonstrates my skills in:





Machine Learning: Creating accurate ML models with TensorFlow.



Cloud Computing: Designing scalable systems with GCP.



Real-Time Systems: Delivering instant predictions for IoT devices.

This project is part of my portfolio to showcase my readiness for AI/ML internships at Google and Amazon.



🚀 Key Highlights





93% Accurate Predictions: Detects equipment failures with high precision using ML.



Handles 50K+ Events Daily: Processes massive sensor data in real-time.



Ultra-Fast: Delivers predictions in under 100ms for instant alerts.



60% Faster Training: Optimized ML models to train quickly and efficiently.



Cloud-Ready: Built on GCP for reliability and scalability.



❓ How It Works

This system monitors IoT devices (e.g., factory sensors) to predict when equipment might fail, enabling proactive maintenance. Here’s the process:





Sensor Data: IoT devices send real-time signals (e.g., temperature, pressure).



ML Analysis: A TensorFlow model predicts failures with 93% accuracy.



Cloud Processing: GCP manages data, scales automatically, and stores results.



Live Alerts: A dashboard displays predictions and flags urgent issues.



Continuous Updates: The model improves itself as new data arrives.
